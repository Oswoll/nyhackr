The nyhackr website was built as a [R Markdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) and the source code can accessed by the community on [GitHub](https://github.com/nyhackr/nyhackr). If you wish to contribute to the website the process is pretty simple.

1. Fork and clon the repository (an example can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
2. Create a new branch for your changes (warning, this step cannot be done in RStudio!)
3. Make your changes. You can build and view your local version by using `rmarkdown::render_site()`
4. When you are done, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your changes might not appear on the public site right away as we have a development version for making sure changes don't break the site.
